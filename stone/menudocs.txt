REQUIREMENTS FOR ORDER HISTORY
process_order:
just pass in the filepath to the json formatted as described
order["orderhistory"]
    needs to contain a dict with keys: "ordernumber", "total", "paymentform", "orderedat", "employeeid"

list of items in order["orderitems"]
    each item in orderitems needs to contain: "linenumber", "ordernumber", "itemname", "sauce", "cheese", "topping1", "topping2", "topping3", "topping4", "drizzle", "dough"
if it is something like a fountain drink, drink, or random item (like cookie) you can leave all of the things that would go with pizza blank (or as None in python not sure what it is for other languages) - sauce, cheese, topping1-4, drizzle, dough
basically info to go in order_history, orderitem_t, and inventory

    "orderhistory": {
        "ordernumber": 54993,
